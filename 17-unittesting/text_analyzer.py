Unit testing example: text analysis
- TODO:
    - write a simple text-analysis function, which takes file name as its only parameters
    - Calculate: 
        - the number of lines in the file
        - the number of characters in the file
- Note: TDD (Test Driven Development) is a form of software development where tests are written 
first i.e. before you write the actual functionality to be tested.

- The unittest module is a framework for developing reliable automated tests
- You define test cases by subclassing from unittest.TestCase
- The unittest.main() function is useful for running all of the tests in a module
- The setUp() and tearDown() fixtures are used to run code before and after each test method.
- Test methods are defined by creating method names that start with test_ on test case objects
- The various TestCase.assert... methods can be used to make a test method fail when the 
  right conditions aren't met
- Use TestCase.assertRaises() in a with statement to check that the right exceptions are thrown
